chloride channels, because chloride is the most abundant anion and the

changes in the transmembrane electric field (voltage-dependent/gated
chloride channels, e.g. ClC family), on a protein kinase/nucleotide
mediated mechanism (CFTR), an increase in intracellular calcium
(calcium activated chloride channels, e.g. CaCC), cell swelling

e.g. glycine or - aminobutyric acid (GABA) activated channels. In
contrast with cation channels, they are not involved in the initiation

nerve and muscle. They also participate in many housekeeping
processes, such as volume regulation, pH regulation in organelles,
electrogenesis and control of synaptic activity. The chloride channels

due to hyperglycemia-induced osmotic diuresis. Type II diabetes

a gradual onset with minimal or no symptoms of metabolic disturbance
Both forms of diabetes mellitus lead to secondary complications

tissue separation within the dermo-epidermal basement membrane
(basement membrane zone, BMZ), primarily within the lamina lucida; in
the dystrophic forms (DEB), tissue separation occurs below the lamina
densa within the upper papillary dermis. Some forms of epidermolysis
bullosa display tissue separation at the basal cell/lamina lucida
interface, at the level of the hemidesmosomes (hemidesmosomal
variants). The hemidesmosomal variants overlap with the traditional

consists of any material produced by cells and secreted into the
surrounding medium, but this term generally applies to the non-

a supportive meshwork around cells and is largely composed of
collagen, laminin, fibronectin and glycosaminoglycans. It can
influence the properties of the cells that it supports. In certain
tissues, specific modifications to the extracellular matrix occur. For
instance, the matrix of bone is mineralized to resist compression</description>

Type I GA is caused by the deficiency of glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase, a
mitochondrial enzyme involved in the metabolism of lysine,
hydroxylysine and tryptophan. Type II GA differs from type I in that
multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiencies result in a large
excretion not only of glutaric acid but also of lactic, ethylmalonic,
butyric, isobutyric, 2-methyl-butyric, and isovaleric acids. GA II can
result from a deficiency of any one of 3 mitochondrial molecules: the

The heterocysts function as the sites for nitrogen fixation under
aerobic conditions. They are formed in response to a lack of fixed
nitrogen (NH4 or NO3). The morphological differentiation is
accompanied by biochemical alterations. The mature heterocysts contain
no functional photosystem II and cannot produce oxygen. Instead, they
contain only photosystem I, which enables them to carry out cyclic
photophosphorylation and ATP regeneration. These changes provide the
appropriate conditions for the functioning of the oxygen-sensitive
nitrogenase</description>

RNAs, ribonucleoprotein (RNPs), and ribosomal subunits (up to about 10
MDa) across the double-membrane nuclear envelope. NPC components,
collectively referred to as nucleoporins (NUPs), can play the role of
both NPC structural components and of docking or interaction partners
for transiently associated nuclear transport factors. The NPC is
composed of at least 30 distinct subunits, shows 8-fold rotational
symmetry with specialized structures on the cyto- and nucleoplasmic
side and in the nuclear envelope embedded core. The MW varies from
about 44-60 MDa in S. cerevisiae to 60-120 MDa in vertebrates, yet the

        <description>Protein involved in the synthesis of peptidoglycan which consists of a

either muramic acid {2-amino-3-O-[(R)-1-carboxyethyl]-2-deoxy-D-
glucose} or L-talosaminuronic acid (2-amino-2-deoxy-L-taluronic acid),
which are usually N-acetylated or N-glycoloylated. The carboxyl group
of the muramic acid is commonly substituted by a peptide containing
residues of both L- and D-amino acids, whereas that of L-
talosaminuronic acid is substituted by a peptide consisting of L-amino
acids only. These peptide units may be cross-linked by a peptide bond,
thereby giving rise to a giant macromolecule that forms the rigid cell
wall (sacculus or murein sacculus). This macromolecule is known to
occur as a monomolecular layer between the inner and outer membrane in
Gram-negative bacteria and as a multimolecular layer, often associated
covalently or non-covalently with various additional compounds
(teichoic acids, neutral polysaccharides. etc.) in Gram-positive

        <description>Protein involved in RNA-mediated gene silencing. This term describes a
number of related processes which use 21- to 25-nucleotide RNAs to
repress the expression of specific target genes. These processes
include the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA by either RNA
interference (RNAi) or endogenously encoded microRNAs (miRNAs) and the
transcriptional regulation of mRNA by RNAi-mediated chromatin
silencing. RNAi is generally triggered by the presence of dsRNA
produced by bidirectional transcription or by the transcription of an
inverted repeat or hairpin sequence. dsRNA is processed into small
interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of around 21 nucleotide which are then
incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which
cleaves mRNAs with sequences fully complementary to the siRNA. miRNAs
differ from siRNAs principally in their biogenesis. miRNA genes encode
precursors with complex hairpin structures which are processed by
endonucleolytic cleavage to form mature miRNAs. Like siRNAs, miRNAs
function in RISC-like complexes. Animal miRNAs generally inhibit
translation of target mRNAs following imperfect base pairing to the
3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR), while most plant miRNAs show nearly
precise complementarity to coding regions of target mRNAs and trigger
mRNA degradation similar to siRNAs. Finally, in RNAi-mediated
chromatin silencing, siRNAs derived from repeat element transcripts
are incorporated into the nuclear RNAi-induced initiator of
transcriptional silencing complex (RITS), where they guide chromatin
modifications such as histone methylation which lead to
transcriptional silencing</description>

specific developmental signals or under circumstances where DNA repair
cannot be completed. Tumor suppressors that act in this way include
